# Processing
A processing project completed for Graphics and Data Visualisation.
This was a project that was completed for university for the module Graphics and Data Visualisation. We were given a data set and a image of the UK map and we had to show what we had learned from the fundamental of computer graphics. It was also required to show skills in design and develop a real-time 3D environment.


# Rationale
The first thing that I did was look up the longitude and latitude data for each of the cities that was given to us on the map. Once all the data was found I added the additional data into the ‘Data.csv’ file. This helped to ensure that when it came to displaying the data on the image that it would be located in the correct cities on the map and that the information shown to the user was accurate.
I set the display window size to 600 x 600. The ‘uk-admin.jpg’ image is set to lie flat, I felt that it was best to do it as it was easier for the user to see the map clearly while zooming and panning. . In addition, it is the most suitable way that the bars in each of the cities that have the census population number from 1991, 2001, and 2003 imported from the ‘Data.csv’. When the processing program is run the user is presented with the information for each of the cities that has census data from 1991, 2001, 2011. By adding this information to the console the user is able to clearly see the population number that the chart is displaying.
Furthermore, the console also gives the user instructions on how they can do the following tasks:
1. Zoom in and Out using certain keys
2. Zoom in and Out using the mouse
3. Pan using the certain keys
4. Pan using the mouse
5. What keys to get the census data
6. Take a snapshot
7. Filter information given to them
8. Remove all of the data from the image
When the user double clicks the left mouse the program will take a 500x500 snapshot of the screen and will save into the McGivern,Aine folder under the name snapshot.png.
The user will also have a button on their screen that when pressed will filter out the graphs that are of a value of under 95000. This allows the user to see less graph boxes and helps with the overall visualisation.
